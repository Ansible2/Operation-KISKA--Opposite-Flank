Our initial Gambit to seize control of <marker name='marker_12'>Malden's airfield</marker> paid off. While this success significantly reduced the URFs ability to project itself in the region as a whole, it has also bought them time to regroup in the islands interior while we consolidated ourselves. 
<br/>
<br/>
In light of some reprieve, the ODSTs are having us put all our cards on the table again. 
<br/> 
<br/>
Alpha and Charlie have been tasked with a simultaneous assault along with us and Delta. We've got <marker name='marker_33'>La Trinite</marker>, they've got <marker name='marker_34'>Larche</marker>. I'm not privy to the details, but the ODSTs have an op planned for later today. 
<br/>
<br/>
The goal for us is <marker name='marker_35'>Hill 429</marker>, the 2nd URF stronghold on Malden. It's only a matter of time before the they are able to mobilize their equipment stockpiles located at the complex and mount an offensive to retake the North, namely the airfield. You can thank them for the harassing artillery also. 
<br/>
<br/>
Once it's gone, however, the enemy will have lost what ONI assures us is they're logistical combat hub. Small arms, rockets, armor, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, we've got intel on three HVTs that should currently be at. If all else fails, you need to eliminate these individuals. You'll find more information on them in the briefing tent.

_player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["Execution","
1. Hades and Wolfpack will insert to the eastern hills overlooking La Trinite no earlier then 0730. They will move rapidly to destroy enemy mortar emplacements at <marker name='marker_100'>Point Talos</marker>.
<br/> 
<br/>  
2. At 0800 Delta will begin its amphibious assault East of <marker name='marker_67'>LZ Sol</marker>. They will be providing blocking positions for enemy reinforcements from the South and West. 
<br/> 
<br/>  
3. Meanwhile Hades and Wolfpack will need to perform Force Reconnaissance of the LZs <marker name='marker_77'>LZ Apollo</marker>, <marker name='marker_76'>LZ Athena</marker>, and <marker name='marker_78'>LZ Helios</marker> prior to the rest of 1st and 2nd platoon's air assault. 
<br/> 
<br/>  
4. During this, at approximately 0815, 3rd and 4th will be conducting their ground assaults of both <marker name='marker_95'>Point Centaur</marker>, and <marker name='marker_96'>Point Cyclops</marker>. 
<br/>
<br/>  
5. At 0825, 1st and 2nd will lift off from the airfield, flying time is estimated at 2.5 minutes. 1st Platoon will move to cut off retreat from <marker name='marker_91'>Point Siren</marker> while 2nd secures it.

// NOTES
_player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["NOTES","
- The forests near POINT TALOS have scattered fireteam sized patrols. Imaging hasn't revealed anything with certainly, but there is likely a camp hidden beneath the canopy. Watch your back near and in that area, they could easily ruin your day while in the process of hitting TALOS. Stick to the North flank if you want to avoid them, but this could expose your team to fire from TALOS 
<br/>
<br/> 
- Point TALOS is secured by approximately two squads of URF. While an approach from the East will give you a optimal cover and concealment in the forest. The South flank looks lightly defended. It will, however, require dodging and/or engaging some patrols. 
<br/>
<br/>
- If you find the LZs to be too hot while the air assault is inbound, you have been provided an encrypted signal to call the pelicans to wave off and return. Just remember, The Pelicans can take a hit. (These can be accessed in the radio trigger menu). 
<br/>
<br/>
- While we don't expect it will be needed, the frigate is on standby to service emergency targets with MAC Strikes via laser designation ONLY. Larche has priority, however. Bottom line, it would benefit the op if you have the ability to designate targets. 
<br/>
<br/> 
- Remember your objectives. You will be behind enemy lines with minimal support for the first phase of the operation. Maintain the element of surprise as much as possible. Hit your targets fast and then rapidly exfil the area. The longer you linger in anyone place, the more risk you run of being surrounded after already making your presence known.  
<br/>
<br/> 
- You will have two resupplies for the team available at request. The frigate will be dropping the pods so watch your head. Error range is within 20m from your position of call. (available in the radio menu)
